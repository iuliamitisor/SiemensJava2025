## Siemens Java Internship - Refactored CRUD & Async Processing Application

This repository contains a refactored Spring Boot application originally created for the Siemens Java Internship program. The project implements a basic CRUD system with additional asynchronous processing logic for item entities. This version improves upon the initial submission by fixing logic flaws and applying best practices.

## ðŸ”§ Key Improvements Made

### âœ… General Enhancements
- Added **exception handling** across the service and controller layers to ensure meaningful error messages and proper HTTP status codes.
- Implemented **validation** on item creation using `@Valid` and resolved issues related to incorrect HTTP responses.
- Improved code readability and maintainability through **concise documentation** and method refactoring.
- Moved source files into appropriate **layered packages** (`controller`, `service`, `repository`, `model`) for cleaner **project structure and separation of concerns**.

### âœ… `ItemService.java`
- Changed return type of `processItemsAsync()` to `CompletableFuture<List<Item>>` for true asynchronous behavior.
- Replaced manual `ExecutorService` logic with Springâ€™s `@Async` annotation for cleaner async task execution.
- Used `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync()` in conjunction with streams to process items in parallel and collect results efficiently.
- Replaced primitive counter with `AtomicInteger` for thread-safe tracking of processed items.
- Added `IllegalStateException` checks for invalid IDs in `findById()` and `deleteById()`.

### âœ… `ItemController.java`
- Annotated item input with `@Valid` to perform built-in validation (including email validation via dependencies).
- Ensured accurate usage of HTTP status codes like `CREATED`, `OK`, `BAD_REQUEST`, and `NOT_FOUND`.
- Refactored `/process` endpoint to handle and return a `CompletableFuture` with the processed items list.
- Implemented global exception handling to catch and respond with appropriate error messages.
